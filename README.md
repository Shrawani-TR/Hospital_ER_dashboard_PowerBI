# Hospital_ER_dashboard_PowerBI
## Project Overview
The **Hospital ER Dashboard** is an end-to-end analytics solution designed to monitor and optimize emergency room operations.  
It provides insights into patient flow, wait times, satisfaction scores, and department referrals, helping hospital administrators make **data-driven decisions**.

## Problem Statement
Hospitals struggle to manage emergency room operations efficiently due to:
- Long patient wait times  
- Lack of real-time insights  
- Difficulty tracking operational performance  

This often leads to poor patient satisfaction and inefficient use of resources.


## Solution
A **Power BI dashboard** was developed using **Excel data** with Power Query transformations to clean and shape the dataset.  
The dashboard includes **four views**:  

1. **Monthly View** – Track trends and patterns month-by-month  
2. **Consolidated View** – Aggregate data over a selected date range  
3. **Patient Details** – Drill-down view with individual patient records  
4. **Summary View** – Overview of key metrics with actionable insights
